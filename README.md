## Project Structure

### üìÅ cpanalyzer-v1
The original implementation using vanilla JavaScript with React via CDN.
- Simple static HTML/JS application
- No build process required
- Uses localStorage for data persistence
- Quick to deploy but limited scalability

### üìÅ cpanalyzer-v2
Modern implementation built with Next.js, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui.
- Full-stack ready architecture
- Type-safe development
- Modern UI components
- Prepared for database integration and multi-tenant support

## Live Demo

**Production URL**: https://cpanalyzerdemo.netlify.app/
